# Using-spectral-analysis-and-mapping-to-enhance-the-harmonicity-of-a-sound
Research MATLAB Project which analyses Inharmonic sounds, tries to find its most likely fundamental frequency and harmonic template, and performs spectral mapping to make it sound more harmonic while retaining most of its sound quality.
